# Project Nexus – E-commerce Backend Documentation

## Project Overview

This repository serves as my final documentation project for the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
It highlights my journey and learnings while developing a **fully functional e-commerce backend system**.  

The goal is to create a central hub of knowledge showcasing backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices.  
This documentation also serves as a **guide for frontend learners** who will integrate their frontend applications with backend APIs.

## Key Technologies

| Technology        | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| Python            | Core backend programming language |
| Django            | Web framework for building backend logic |
| Django REST Framework | Building RESTful APIs |
| PostgreSQL        | Relational database management system |
| Docker            | Containerization and deployment |
| Celery + RabbitMQ | Asynchronous background task processing |
| GitHub Actions    | Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) |
| Swagger/OpenAPI   | API documentation and testing |

## Backend Concepts Learned

This project captures key backend engineering concepts I studied during the program:

- **Database Design**
  - Designing normalized relational databases.
  - Creating efficient indexes to optimize queries.
  - Structuring tables for scalability and growth.

- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - Implementing background tasks for sending order confirmations and notifications using Celery & RabbitMQ.

- **Caching Strategies**
  - Improving performance with Redis caching for frequently accessed product data.

- **API Design**
  - RESTful API principles with Django REST Framework.
  - Proper error handling and secure authentication mechanisms.

- **Security Best Practices**
  - Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
  - Rate limiting to protect APIs against abuse.
  - Secure authentication and password handling.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Handling peak order volumes without slowing down the API.  
**Solution:** Implemented asynchronous processing with Celery and RabbitMQ to process high-volume tasks in the background.

**Challenge:** Reducing database query times for product catalog searches.  
**Solution:** Added indexing to frequently queried fields and implemented Redis caching.

**Challenge:** Clear documentation for frontend developers.  
**Solution:** Created a separate `api-endpoints.md` file with all routes and usage examples.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write **clean, modular, and reusable code** to improve maintainability.
- Proper **version control** using GitHub is essential for collaboration.
- Document everything — clear documentation saves time and prevents confusion.
- Building with scalability in mind ensures future growth and stability.
- Security should never be an afterthought; it must be designed from the start.

## Collaboration Notes

Although I am working solo, this backend was built with **team collaboration in mind**.  
If frontend learners were integrating with this system, they would rely on these APIs to:

- Display products and categories.
- Manage carts and checkout flows.
- Handle user registration and authentication.

**Collaboration Platform:**  

All collaboration would happen on the dedicated Discord channel `#ProDevProjectNexus`.

---

## System Design

### Entities (ERD):

- **Users** – customer accounts and authentication.
- **Products** – catalog with details like name, description, and price.
- **Categories** – grouping of similar products.
- **Orders** – tracks purchase details.
- **Cart** – manages items before checkout.
- **Payments** – tracks payment details and statuses.

A detailed ERD diagram is provided in the `diagrams/` folder.

## API Endpoints Reference

For detailed endpoint descriptions, refer to the `docs/api-endpoints.md` file.

| Endpoint            | Method | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/products/`    | GET    | Retrieve all products |
| `/api/products/<id>/` | GET  | Retrieve a single product |
| `/api/cart/`        | POST   | Add an item to the cart |
| `/api/cart/`        | GET    | View items in the cart |
| `/api/orders/`      | POST   | Place an order |
| `/api/orders/<id>/` | GET    | View order details |

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shantralee-58/alx-project-nexus.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd alx-project-nexus

# Build and run using Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

Once running, access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

## Reflection

Project Nexus gave me the opportunity to **apply my learning in a practical, real-world scenario**.  
This project not only solidified my backend engineering skills but also taught me the value of documentation, planning, and scalability in software development.
